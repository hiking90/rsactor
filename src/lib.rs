//! # rsActor
//! A Lightweight Rust Actor Framework with Simple Yet Powerful Task Control
//!
//! `rsActor` is a lightweight, Tokio-based actor framework in Rust focused on providing simple
//! yet powerful task control. It prioritizes simplicity and efficiency for local, in-process
//! actor systems while giving developers complete control over their actors' execution lifecycle â€”
//! define your own `on_run`, control execution, control the lifecycle.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Asynchronous Actors**: Actors run in their own asynchronous tasks.
//! - **Message Passing**: Actors communicate by sending and receiving messages.
//!   - `tell`: Send a message without waiting for a reply (fire-and-forget).
//!   - `tell_with_timeout`: Send a message without waiting for a reply, with a specified timeout.
//!   - `ask`: Send a message and await a reply.
//!   - `ask_with_timeout`: Send a message and await a reply, with a specified timeout.
//!   - `tell_blocking`: Blocking version of `tell` for use in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` tasks.
//!   - `ask_blocking`: Blocking version of `ask` for use in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` tasks.
//! - **Actor Lifecycle with Simple Yet Powerful Task Control**: Actors have `on_start` and `on_run` lifecycle hooks.
//!   The distinctive `on_run` feature provides a dedicated task execution environment that users can control
//!   with simple yet powerful primitives, unlike other actor frameworks. This gives developers complete control over
//!   their actor's task logic while the framework manages the underlying execution.
//! - **Graceful Shutdown & Kill**: Actors can be stopped gracefully or killed immediately.
//! - **Typed Messages**: Messages are strongly typed, and replies are also typed.
//! - **Macro for Message Handling**: The `impl_message_handler!` macro simplifies
//!   handling multiple message types.
//!
//! ## Core Concepts
//!
//! - **`Actor`**: Trait defining actor behavior and lifecycle hooks (`on_start`, `on_run`).
//! - **`Message<M>`**: Trait for handling a message type `M` and defining its reply type.
//! - **`ActorRef`**: Handle for sending messages to an actor.
//! - **`spawn`**: Function to create and start an actor, returning an `ActorRef` and a `JoinHandle`.
//! - **`MessageHandler`**: Trait for type-erased message handling. This is typically implemented automatically by the `impl_message_handler!` macro.
//! - **`ActorResult`**: Enum representing the outcome of an actor's lifecycle (e.g., completed, failed).
//! - **`MailboxMessage(Internal)`**: Enum for messages in an actor's mailbox (user messages and control signals).
//! - **`Runtime(Internal)`**: Manages an actor's internal lifecycle and message loop.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! Define an actor struct, implement `Actor` and `Message<M>` for each message type.
//! Use `impl_message_handler!` to wire up message handling.
//! All `Actor` lifecycle methods (`on_start`, `on_run`) are optional
//! and have default implementations.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use rsactor::{Actor, ActorRef, Message, impl_message_handler, spawn};
//! use anyhow::Result;
//!
//! // 1. Define your actor struct
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! struct MyActor {
//!     data: String,
//! }
//!
//! impl MyActor {
//!     fn new(data: &str) -> Self {
//!         MyActor { data: data.to_string() }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // 2. Implement the Actor trait (on_start, on_stop, on_run are optional)
//! impl Actor for MyActor {
//!     type Args = String; // Define an args type for actor creation
//!     type Error = anyhow::Error; // Define an error type
//!
//!     // Required: Implement on_start for actor creation and initialization
//!     async fn on_start(args: Self::Args, _actor_ref: &ActorRef) -> std::result::Result<Self, Self::Error> {
//!         println!("MyActor (data: '{}') started!", args);
//!         Ok(MyActor { data: args })
//!     }
//!
//!     // Optional: Implement on_run for the actor's main execution logic.
//!     // This method is called after on_start. If it returns Ok(false), the actor stops normally.
//!     // If it returns Err(_), the actor stops due to an error.
//!     // If it returns Ok(true), the actor continues running.
//!     async fn on_run(&mut self, _actor_ref: &ActorRef) -> Result<bool, Self::Error> {
//!         let mut tick_300ms = tokio::time::interval(std::time::Duration::from_millis(300));
//!         let mut tick_1s = tokio::time::interval(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1));
//!         tokio::select! {
//!             _ = tick_300ms.tick() => {
//!                 println!("Tick: 300ms");
//!             }
//!             _ = tick_1s.tick() => {
//!                 println!("Tick: 1s");
//!             }
//!         }
//!         Ok(true) // Continue running
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // 3. Define your message types
//! struct GetData; // A message to get the actor's data
//! struct UpdateData(String); // A message to update the actor's data
//!
//! // 4. Implement Message<M> for each message type
//! impl Message<GetData> for MyActor {
//!     type Reply = String; // This message will return a String
//!
//!     async fn handle(&mut self, _msg: GetData, _actor_ref: &ActorRef) -> Self::Reply {
//!         self.data.clone()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl Message<UpdateData> for MyActor {
//!     type Reply = (); // This message does not return a value
//!
//!     async fn handle(&mut self, msg: UpdateData, _actor_ref: &ActorRef) -> Self::Reply {
//!         self.data = msg.0;
//!         println!("MyActor data updated!");
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // 5. Use the macro to implement the MessageHandler trait
//! impl_message_handler!(MyActor, [GetData, UpdateData]);
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!     let (actor_ref, join_handle) = spawn::<MyActor>("initial data".to_string());
//!
//!
//!     // Send an "ask" message and wait for a reply
//!     let current_data: String = actor_ref.ask(GetData).await?;
//!     println!("Received data: {}", current_data);
//!
//!     // Send a "tell" message (fire-and-forget)
//!     actor_ref.tell(UpdateData("new data".to_string())).await?;
//!
//!     // Verify the update
//!     let updated_data: String = actor_ref.ask(GetData).await?;
//!     println!("Updated data: {}", updated_data);
//!
//!     // Stop the actor gracefully
//!     actor_ref.stop().await?;
//!
//!     // Wait for the actor to terminate
//!     let actor_result = join_handle.await?;
//!     println!("Actor stopped with result: {:?}", actor_result);
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```

    /// process incoming messages from its mailbox.
    ///
    /// # Key characteristics:
    ///
    /// - **Iterative Execution**: The `rsactor` runtime invokes `on_run` to obtain a `Future`.
    ///   If this `Future` completes with `Ok(true)`, `on_run` may be called again by the
    ///   runtime to obtain a new `Future`. This allows for continuous or step-by-step
    ///   task processing throughout the actor's active lifecycle.
    ///
    /// - **State Persistence Across Invocations**: Because `on_run` can be invoked multiple
    ///   times by the runtime (each time generating a new `Future`), any state intended
    ///   to persist across these distinct invocations *must* be stored as fields within
    ///   the actor's struct (`self`). Local variables declared inside `on_run` are ephemeral
    ///   and will not be preserved if `on_run` completes and is subsequently re-invoked.
    ///
    /// - **Concurrent Message Handling**: The `Future` returned by `on_run` executes
    ///   concurrently with the actor's message processing loop. This allows the actor to
    ///   perform its `on_run` tasks while simultaneously remaining responsive to incoming
    ///   messages.
    ///
    /// - **Full State Access**: `on_run` has full mutable access to the actor's state (`self`).
    ///   Modifications to `self` within `on_run` are visible to subsequent message handlers
    ///   and future `on_run` invocations.
    ///
    /// - **Essential Await Points**: The `Future` returned by `on_run` must yield control
    ///   to the Tokio runtime via `.await` points, especially within any internal loops.
    ///   Lacking these, the `on_run` task could block the actor's ability to process messages
    ///   or perform other concurrent activities.
    ///
    /// # Common patterns:
    ///
    /// 1. **Periodic tasks**: For executing work at regular intervals. The `on_run` future
    ///    would typically involve a single tick of an interval. The `Interval` itself
