/// # Usage Patterns
///
/// ## Basic Error Handling
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use rsactor::{Actor, ActorRef, spawn, ActorResult};
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// # struct MyActor;
/// # impl Actor for MyActor {
/// #     type Args = ();
/// #     type Error = anyhow::Error;
/// #     async fn on_start(_: (), _: &ActorRef<Self>) -> Result<Self> { Ok(MyActor) }
/// # }
/// # async fn example() -> Result<()> {
/// let (actor_ref, join_handle) = spawn::<MyActor>(());
///
/// match join_handle.await? {
///     ActorResult::Completed { actor, killed } => {
///         println!("Actor completed successfully, killed: {}", killed);
///         // Use the recovered actor instance
///     }
///     ActorResult::Failed { error, phase, .. } => {
///         eprintln!("Actor failed in phase {:?}: {}", phase, error);
///         // Handle the error appropriately
///     }
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```

/// ## Actor Supervision
