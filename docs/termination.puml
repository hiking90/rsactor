participant "MailboxChannel (mpsc)" as MailboxChannel

== Stop Operation (Graceful) ==
Client -> ActorRef_obj: actor_ref.stop().await
activate ActorRef_obj
ActorRef_obj -> MailboxChannel: sender.send(MailboxMessage::StopGracefully).await
deactivate ActorRef_obj
note right of Client: Client awaits JoinHandle or stop() completion

MailboxChannel -> Runtime_obj: receiver.recv() gets StopGracefully
activate Runtime_obj
Runtime_obj -> Runtime_obj: Sets gracefully_stopping = true, final_reason = Normal
Runtime_obj -> MailboxChannel: receiver.close() (stops new messages)
note right of Runtime_obj: Continues processing existing messages in mailbox
Runtime_obj -> Runtime_obj: Loop breaks when mailbox is empty (recv() returns None)

Runtime_obj -> on_stop_method: Calls actor.on_stop(actor_ref, &ActorStopReason::Normal)
activate on_stop_method
on_stop_method --> Runtime_obj: Returns Result
deactivate on_stop_method
Runtime_obj --> JoinHandle_obj: Task finishes, JoinHandle resolves with (actor_state, ActorStopReason::Normal)
deactivate Runtime_obj


== Kill Operation (Immediate) ==
Client -> ActorRef_obj: actor_ref.kill()
activate ActorRef_obj
ActorRef_obj -> TerminateChannel: terminate_sender.try_send(ControlSignal::Terminate)
deactivate ActorRef_obj

TerminateChannel -> Runtime_obj: terminate_receiver.recv() gets Terminate (prioritized via biased select!)
activate Runtime_obj
Runtime_obj -> Runtime_obj: Sets final_reason = Killed
Runtime_obj -> MailboxChannel: receiver.close()
Runtime_obj -> TerminateChannel: terminate_receiver.close()
Runtime_obj -> Runtime_obj: Breaks message loop immediately

Runtime_obj -> on_stop_method: Calls actor.on_stop(actor_ref, &ActorStopReason::Killed)
activate on_stop_method
on_stop_method --> Runtime_obj: Returns Result
deactivate on_stop_method
Runtime_obj --> JoinHandle_obj: Task finishes, JoinHandle resolves with (actor_state, ActorStopReason::Killed)
deactivate Runtime_obj
