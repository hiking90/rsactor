participant "TerminateChannel (mpsc)" as TerminateChannel
participant "run_actor_lifecycle()" as Lifecycle

== Normal Operation ==
Lifecycle -> on_run_method: Calls actor.on_run(actor_ref) continuously
activate on_run_method
note right of on_run_method: on_run() runs in a loop\nuntil stop/kill signal received
on_run_method --> Lifecycle: Returns Ok(()) or Err(error)
note right of Lifecycle: If Ok(()), on_run is called again\nIf Err(), actor fails

== Stop Operation (Graceful) ==
Client -> ActorRef_obj: actor_ref.stop().await
activate ActorRef_obj
ActorRef_obj -> MailboxChannel: sender.send(MailboxMessage::StopGracefully).await
deactivate ActorRef_obj
note right of Client: Client awaits JoinHandle or stop() completion

MailboxChannel -> Lifecycle: receiver.recv() gets StopGracefully
activate Lifecycle
Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Sets was_killed = false
Lifecycle -> on_run_method: Signals to exit current on_run
deactivate on_run_method
Lifecycle -> on_stop_method: Calls actor.on_stop(StopReason::Graceful)
activate on_stop_method
on_stop_method --> Lifecycle: Returns Ok(()) or Err(error)
deactivate on_stop_method
Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Breaks message loop
Lifecycle -> MailboxChannel: receiver.close()
Lifecycle -> TerminateChannel: terminate_receiver.close()
Lifecycle --> JoinHandle_obj: Task finishes, JoinHandle resolves with ActorResult::Completed { killed: false, .. }
deactivate Lifecycle

== Kill Operation (Immediate) ==
Client -> ActorRef_obj: actor_ref.kill()
activate ActorRef_obj
ActorRef_obj -> TerminateChannel: terminate_sender.try_send(ControlSignal::Terminate)
deactivate ActorRef_obj

TerminateChannel -> Lifecycle: terminate_receiver.recv() gets Terminate (prioritized via biased select!)
activate Lifecycle
Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Sets was_killed = true
Lifecycle -> on_run_method: Aborts current on_run immediately
deactivate on_run_method
Lifecycle -> on_stop_method: Calls actor.on_stop(StopReason::Killed)
activate on_stop_method
on_stop_method --> Lifecycle: Returns Ok(()) or Err(error)
deactivate on_stop_method
Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Breaks message loop immediately
Lifecycle -> MailboxChannel: receiver.close()
Lifecycle -> TerminateChannel: terminate_receiver.close()
Lifecycle --> JoinHandle_obj: Task finishes, JoinHandle resolves with ActorResult::Completed { killed: true, .. }
deactivate Lifecycle

== Termination via on_run Error ==
Lifecycle -> on_run_method: Calls actor.on_run(actor_ref)
activate on_run_method
on_run_method --> Lifecycle: Returns Err(error)
deactivate on_run_method
Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Sets was_killed = false
Lifecycle -> on_stop_method: Calls actor.on_stop(StopReason::Error(error))
activate on_stop_method
on_stop_method --> Lifecycle: Returns Ok(()) or Err(cleanup_error)
deactivate on_stop_method
Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Breaks message loop
Lifecycle --> JoinHandle_obj: Task finishes, JoinHandle resolves with ActorResult::Failed { cause, .. }
deactivate Lifecycle
