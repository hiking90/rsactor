== Initialization Phase ==
Spawn -> Lifecycle: Start actor task
activate Lifecycle
Lifecycle -> OnStart: Call on_start(args, &actor_ref)
activate OnStart

alt Successful Initialization
    OnStart --> Lifecycle: Ok(actor_instance)
    deactivate OnStart
    note right of Lifecycle: Actor instance created successfully
    Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Store actor instance
    Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Create ActorWeak reference
    Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Enter main processing loop
else Initialization Failure
    OnStart --> Lifecycle: Err(error)
    deactivate OnStart
    Lifecycle --> JoinHandle: ActorResult::Failed { phase: OnStart, actor: None, error, killed: false }
    deactivate Lifecycle
    note right of JoinHandle: Actor never started - no instance available
end

== Processing Phase ==
loop Main Actor Loop
    Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: tokio::select! (biased)

    alt Termination Signal (Highest Priority)
        Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Received ControlSignal::Terminate
        note right of Lifecycle: Kill signal has highest priority
        Lifecycle -> OnStop: Call on_stop(&actor_weak, killed = true)
    else Graceful Stop Message
        Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Received StopGracefully message
        Lifecycle -> OnStop: Call on_stop(&actor_weak, killed = false)
    else Mailbox Closed
        Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: All ActorRef instances dropped
        Lifecycle -> OnStop: Call on_stop(&actor_weak, killed = false)
    else Message Received
        Lifecycle -> Lifecycle: Process incoming message
        note right of Lifecycle: Handle message via MessageHandler trait
    else on_run Execution
        Lifecycle -> OnRun: Call actor.on_run(&actor_weak)
        activate OnRun

        alt on_run Success
            OnRun --> Lifecycle: Ok(())
            deactivate OnRun
            note right of Lifecycle: Continue loop - on_run will be called again
        else on_run Failure
            OnRun --> Lifecycle: Err(error)
            deactivate OnRun
            note right of Lifecycle
              Actor terminates due to runtime error.
              on_stop is NOT called for on_run errors.
            end note
            Lifecycle --> JoinHandle: ActorResult::Failed { phase: OnRun, actor: Some(actor), error, killed }
        end
    end
end

== Termination Phase ==
note over Lifecycle, OnStop
  on_stop is only called for explicit stop/kill requests
  or when all ActorRef instances are dropped.
  It is NOT called when on_run returns an error.
end note

activate OnStop
alt on_stop Success
    OnStop --> Lifecycle: Ok(())
    deactivate OnStop
    Lifecycle --> JoinHandle: ActorResult::Completed { actor, killed: false/true }

else on_stop Failure
    OnStop --> Lifecycle: Err(stop_error)
    deactivate OnStop
    Lifecycle --> JoinHandle: ActorResult::Failed { phase: OnStop, actor: Some(actor), error: stop_error, killed }
end

deactivate Lifecycle

== Result Handling ==
JoinHandle -> JoinHandle: await join_handle
activate JoinHandle

alt ActorResult::Completed
    note right of JoinHandle
        Actor completed successfully
        - Final actor state available
        - killed flag indicates termination type
    end note
else ActorResult::Failed
    note right of JoinHandle
        Actor failed during lifecycle
        - phase indicates where failure occurred
        - error contains failure details
        - actor state may be available for recovery
    end note
end

deactivate JoinHandle

== Lifecycle Method Characteristics ==

note over OnStart
  on_start():
  ✅ Required implementation
  ✅ Creates actor instance
  ✅ Can perform async initialization
  ✅ Failure prevents actor creation
  ✅ Receives ActorRef for self-reference
end note

note over OnRun
  on_run():
  ✅ Optional (has default implementation)
  ✅ Called repeatedly while actor lives
  ✅ Runs concurrently with message handling
  ✅ Ok(()) continues execution
  ✅ Err() terminates actor
  ✅ Receives ActorWeak to avoid cycles
end note

note over OnStop
  on_stop():
  ✅ Optional (has default implementation)
  ✅ Called before actor terminates
  ✅ killed flag indicates termination type
  ✅ Can perform cleanup operations
  ✅ Failure affects final ActorResult
  ✅ Receives ActorWeak reference
end note
