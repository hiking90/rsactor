title Actor Creation and Spawning

actor User
participant "UserActor Struct" as UserActor
participant "spawn()" as spawn_func
participant "ActorRef" as ActorRef_type
participant "mpsc::channel (mailbox)" as MailboxChannel
participant "mpsc::channel (terminate)" as TerminateChannel
participant "Runtime" as Runtime_type
participant "tokio::spawn" as tokio_spawn
participant "Runtime::run_actor_lifecycle()" as run_lifecycle
participant "Actor::on_start()" as on_start_method
participant "Actor::run_loop()" as run_loop_method

User -> UserActor: Defines struct & impl Actor, Message<M>
User -> spawn_func: Calls spawn(user_actor_instance)
activate spawn_func

spawn_func -> MailboxChannel: Creates (mailbox_tx, mailbox_rx)
spawn_func -> TerminateChannel: Creates (terminate_tx, terminate_rx)
spawn_func -> ActorRef_type: Creates ActorRef (with id, mailbox_tx, terminate_tx)
spawn_func -> Runtime_type: Creates Runtime (with actor_instance, actor_ref_clone, mailbox_rx, terminate_rx)
spawn_func -> tokio_spawn: Spawns Runtime::run_actor_lifecycle()
activate tokio_spawn
spawn_func --> User: Returns (ActorRef, JoinHandle)
deactivate spawn_func

tokio_spawn -> run_lifecycle: Executes
activate run_lifecycle
run_lifecycle -> on_start_method: Calls actor.on_start(actor_ref)
activate on_start_method
on_start_method --> run_lifecycle: Returns Result
deactivate on_start_method
run_lifecycle -> run_loop_method: Calls actor.run_loop(actor_ref) if on_start is Ok
activate run_loop_method
run_loop_method --> run_lifecycle: Eventually returns Result
deactivate run_loop_method
note right of run_lifecycle: Processes messages concurrently with run_loop

run_lifecycle -> on_stop_method: Calls actor.on_stop(actor_ref, &ActorStopReason) when run_loop completes
activate on_stop_method
on_stop_method --> run_lifecycle: Returns Result
deactivate on_stop_method

run_lifecycle --> tokio_spawn: (Eventually completes)
deactivate run_lifecycle
tokio_spawn --> User: (JoinHandle resolves when task finishes)
deactivate tokio_spawn
