title Actor Creation and Spawning

actor User
participant "UserActor Struct" as UserActor
participant "spawn()" as spawn_func
participant "ActorRef" as ActorRef_type
participant "mpsc::channel (mailbox)" as MailboxChannel
participant "mpsc::channel (terminate)" as TerminateChannel
participant "Runtime" as Runtime_type
participant "tokio::spawn" as tokio_spawn
participant "run_actor_lifecycle()" as run_lifecycle
participant "Actor::on_start(Args)" as on_start_method
participant "Actor::on_run()" as on_run_method

User -> UserActor: Defines struct & impl Actor (with Args), Message<M>
User -> spawn_func: Calls spawn(actor_args)
activate spawn_func

spawn_func -> MailboxChannel: Creates (mailbox_tx, mailbox_rx)
spawn_func -> TerminateChannel: Creates (terminate_tx, terminate_rx)
spawn_func -> ActorRef_type: Creates ActorRef (with id, mailbox_tx, terminate_tx)
spawn_func -> tokio_spawn: Spawns run_actor_lifecycle(args, actor_ref, ...)\nactivate tokio_spawn
spawn_func --> User: Returns (ActorRef, JoinHandle)
deactivate spawn_func

tokio_spawn -> run_lifecycle: Executes
activate run_lifecycle
run_lifecycle -> on_start_method: Calls T::on_start(args, actor_ref)
activate on_start_method
on_start_method --> run_lifecycle: Returns Result<ActorInstance, Error>
deactivate on_start_method

note right of run_lifecycle
  If on_start is Ok, actor instance is created.
  The runtime then repeatedly calls actor.on_run()
  to get Futures for execution.
  Message processing happens concurrently.
end note
run_lifecycle -> on_run_method: Calls actor.on_run(actor_ref)
activate on_run_method
on_run_method --> run_lifecycle: Returns Future<Output = Result<(), Error>>
deactivate on_run_method
note right of run_lifecycle
  If Future returns Ok(()), on_run may be called again.
  If Err, actor stops.
  The outcome is ActorResult.
end note

run_lifecycle --> tokio_spawn: (Eventually completes with ActorResult)
deactivate run_lifecycle
tokio_spawn --> User: (JoinHandle resolves with ActorResult when task finishes)
deactivate tokio_spawn
