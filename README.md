# Project Overview

This project is based on the [`ractor`](https://github.com/slawlor/ractor) framework but introduces several key differences to simplify its structure and improve maintainability.

## Key Differences

1. **Removal of Remote Support**  
   - The remote support functionality has been removed to simplify the overall architecture.
   - If remote functionality is required, consider using the original [`ractor`](https://github.com/slawlor/ractor) framework.

2. **Minimized Use of Global Static Variables**  
   - Reduced reliance on global static variables to enhance modularity and maintainability.
   - This change improves performance and facilitates better unit testing.

3. **Elimination of Unnecessary Features**  
   - Certain features deemed unnecessary have been removed to keep the project lightweight and efficient.

## Motivation
The primary goal of this project is to provide a streamlined and efficient actor-based framework by focusing on core functionalities while reducing complexity.
